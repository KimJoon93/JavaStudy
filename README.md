+ Difference between Overriding and Overloading
  1. Overriding\
  The subclass redefine the methods that the superclass has.
  2. Overloading\
  A technique to have multiple methods with the same name, but different types and numbers of parameters.

+ Difference between implement and extends
  1. Implement\
  It's same as extends but there are some differences. Implement must redefine parent method. And it can get multiple inheritance.
  2. Extends\
  Java doesn't support mulitiple inheritance!
